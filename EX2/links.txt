++i is sometimes faster than, and is never slower than, i++
For intrinsic types like int, it doesn't matter: ++i and i++ are the same speed. For class types like iterators or the previous FAQ's Number class, ++i very well might be faster than i++ since the latter might make a copy of the this object

i++ could potentially be slower than ++i, since the old value of i might need to be saved for later use, but in practice all modern compilers will optimize this away.




Perhaps true: which of these two operations expresses more accurately what you are trying to accomplish.
